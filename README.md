# Project Name

Amazon S3 - Reverse proxy cache using NGINX and HAProxy.

This is just a proof of concept to setup a reverse proxy cache of S3 assets, that will be used instead of Amazon S3. If using in production, you need to plan and adjust the configuration accordingly (implement SSL etc..) 

## Usage

1. Place files within their respective configuration directories.
2. Replace public_ip and [bucket_name] placeholders in both scripts with relevant information
3. Ensure that firewall rules are set up / disabled
